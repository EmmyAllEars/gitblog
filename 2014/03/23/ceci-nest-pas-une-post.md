ROS (at footlights): How  very  intriguing!  (Turns.)  I  feel  like  a
spectator - an appalling  business. The only thing that makes it bearable is
the irrational belief that somebody interesting will come on in a minute...
     GUIL: See anyone?
     ROS: No. You?
     GUIL:  No.  (At footlights.)  What  a  fine  persecution -  to be  kept
intrigued without  ever  quite being enlightened...  (Pause.) We've  had  no
practice.
     ROS: We could play at questions.
     GUIL: What good would that do?
     ROS: Practice!
     GUIL: Statement! One-love.
     ROS: Cheating!
     GUIL: How?
     ROS: I hadn't started yet.
     GUIL: Statement. Two-love.
     ROS: Are you counting that?
     GUIL: What?
     ROS: Are you counting that?
     GUIL: Foul! No repetitions. Three-love. First game to...
     ROS: I'm not going to play if you're going to be like that.
     GUIL: Whose serve?
     ROS: Hah?
     GUIL: Foul! No grunts. Love-one.
     ROS: Whose go?
     GUIL: Why?
     ROS: Why not?
     GUIL: What for?
     ROS: Foul! No synonyms! One-all.
     GUIL: What in God's name is going all?
     ROS: Foul! No rhetoric. Two-one.
     GUIL: What does it all add up to?
     ROS: Can't you guess?
     GUIL: Were you addressing me?
     ROS: Is there anyone else?
     GUIL: Who?
     ROS: How would I know?
     GUIL: Why do you ask?
     ROS: Are you serious?
     GUIL: Was that rhetoric?
     ROS: No.
     GUIL: Statement! Two-all. Game point.
     ROS: What's the matter with you today?
     GUIL: When?
     ROS: What?
     GUIL: Are you deaf?
     ROS: Am I dead?
     GUIL: Yes or no?
     ROS: Is there a choice?
     GUIL: Is there a God?
     ROS: Foul! No non sequiturs, three-two, one game all.
     GUIL (seriously): What's your name?
     ROS: What's yours?
     GUIL: I asked you first.
     ROS: Statement. One-love.
     GUIL: What's your name when you're at home?
     ROS: What's yours?
     GUIL: When I'm at home?
     ROS: Is it different at home?
     GUIL: What home?
     ROS: Haven't you got one?
     GUIL: Why do you ask?
     ROS: What are you driving at?
     GUIL (with emphasis): What's your name?!
     ROS: Repetition. Two-love. Match point to me.
     GUIL (seizing him violently): WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
     ROS: Rhetoric! Game and match! (Pause.) Where's it going to end?
     GUIL: That's the question.
     ROS: It's all questions.
     GUIL: Do you think it matters?
     ROS: Doesn't it matter to you?
     GUIL: Why should it matter?
     ROS: What does it matter why?
     GUIL (teasing gently): Doesn't it matter why it matters?
     ROS (rounding on him): What's the matter with you?
     (Pause.)
     GUIL: It doesn't matter.
     ROS (voice in the wilderness): ... What's the game?
     GUIL: What are the rules?
     (Enter  HAMLET behind, crossing  the  stage, reading a book -  as he is
about to disappear GUIL notices him.)
     GUIL (sharply): Rosencrantz!
     ROS (jumps): What?
     (HAMLET goes. Triumph dawns on them, they smile.)
     GUIL: There! How was that?
     ROS: Clever!
     GUIL: Natural?
     ROS: Instinctive.
     GUIL: Got it in your head?
     ROS: I take my hat off you.
     GUIL: Shake hands.
     (They do.)
     ROS: Now I'll try you - Guil - !
     GUIL: - Not yet - catch me unawares.
     ROS: Right. (They separate. Pause. Aside to GUIL.) Ready?
     GUIL (explodes): Don't be stupid.
     ROS: Sorry.
     (Pause.)
     GUIL (snaps): Guildenstern!
     ROS (jumps): What? (He is immediately crestfallen, GUIL is disgusted.)
     GUIL: Consistency is all I ask!
     ROS (guilty): Give us this day our daily week...
     (Beat.)
     ROS: Who was that?
     GUIL: Didn't you know him?
     ROS: He didn't know me.
     GUIL: He didn't see you.
     ROS: I didn't see him.
     GUIL: We shall see. I hardly knew him, he's changed.
     ROS: You could see that?
     GUIL: Transformed.
     ROS: How do you know?
     GUIL: Inside and out.
     ROS: I see.
     GUIL: He's not himself.
     ROS: He's changed.
     GUIL: I could see that. (Beat.) Glean what afflicts him.
     ROS: Me?
     GUIL: Him.
     ROS: How?
     GUIL: Question and answer. Old ways are the best ways.
     ROS: He's afflicted.
     GUIL: You question, I'll answer.
     ROS: He's not himself, you know.
     GUIL: I'm him, you see.
     (Beat.)
     ROS: Who am I then?
     GUIL: You're yourself.
     ROS: And he's you?
     GUIL: Not a bit of it.
     ROS: Are you afflicted?
     GUIL: That's the idea. Are you ready?
     ROS: Let's go back a bit.
     GUIL: I'm afflicted.
     ROS: I see.
     GUIL: Glean what afflicts me.
     ROS: Right.
     GUIL: Question and answer.
     ROS: How should I begin?
     GUIL: Address me.
     ROS: My dear Guildenstern!
     GUIL (quietly): You've forgotten - haven't you?
     ROS: My dear Rosencrantz!
     GUIL (great control):  I don't think you  quite understand. What we are
attempting is  a  hypothesis  in which  I  answer for him,  while you ask me
questions.
     ROS: Ah! Ready?
     GUIL: You know what to do?
     ROS: What?
     GUIL: Are you stupid?
     ROS: Pardon?
     GUIL: Are you deaf?
     ROS: Did you speak?
     GUIL (admonishing): Not now -
     ROS: Statement.
     GUIL (shouts): Not now! (Pause.) If  I had my doubts, or rather  hopes,
they  are  dispelled. What  could we  possibly  have in  common  except  our
situation? (They separate and sit.) Perhaps he'll come back this way.
     ROS: Should we go?
     GUIL: Why?
     (Pause.)
     ROS (starts up. Snaps  fingers.): Oh! You mean - you pretend to be him,
and I ask you questions!
     GUIL (dry): Very good.
     ROS: You had me confused.
     GUIL: I could see I had.
     ROS: How should I begin?
     GUIL: Address me.
     (They stand and face each other, posing.)
     ROS: My honoured Lord!
     GUIL: My dear Rosencrantz!
     (Pause.)
     ROS: Am I pretending to be you, then?
     GUIL: Certainly not. If you like. Shall we continue?
     ROS: Question and answer.
     GUIL: Right.
     ROS: Right. My honoured Lord!
     GUIL: My dear fellow!
     ROS: How are you?
     GUIL: Afflicted!
     ROS: Really? In what way?
     GUIL: Transformed.
     ROS: Inside or out?
     GUIL: Both.
     ROS: I see. (Pause.) No much new there.
